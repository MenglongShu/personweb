<p>SpinnerClockDesignProject Spring,2014 Chicago,IL  DesignedandconstructedaclocktodisplayHH:MM:SSusingonlytenLEDs.  Displayed in space using the persistence-of-vision effect with the circuitry consisting of the MPS430 LaunchPad microcontrollerdevelopment system andacustom-madeLED driver/interfaceboard.  SuccessfullydemonstratedattheUIC 2014EngineeringEXPO.
RoboticsResearch&DesignProject Fall,2013 Chicago,IL  Outlinedanalgorithm tomakeAldebaranNaorobotinitiate.  Used software Choregraphe which includes a graphical programming tool to realize some basic movement, like sitting down,gettingup,turninghead,walkingahead.  With help of JNAOqi, an open source project that allows you to call any NAOqi module method from Java,wrote some codes in Java to produce effect view that Nao can turn its head as to track the location of a person speaking to it. Also, aftersmallinteraction,Naocansave thatperson’snameandmatchwith aspecificperson.
